Hello and welcome to my first public repository!

First of all, let me introduce myself: my names is Cezar Augusto Waissmann de Araujo, I'm a graduated electrical engineer and right now I'm a posgraduate student in Business Intelligence. Throughout my course I will learn many programming languages and use several softwares to enhance my abilitys in:

The goal of this repository is to upload and show all my hard work and development until the end of my postgraduate course. Beyond that, I hope the codes that will be uploaded here gives insight to everyone who is learning about programming.

Thank you, enjoy the repository!
